newfileplanning.py generates the domain.pddl file and the problem.pddl file (easier way to write pddl files using pythn language) with cmd: python -m py2pddl.parse newfileplanning.py

execute.txt is the classical planning generated by the ff solver using the domain.pddl file and the problem.pddl file with cmd: ./ff -o domain.pddl -f problem.pddl >execute.txt

execute.txt is the classical planning generated by the ff solver

torobot.py file contains the file that should be sent to the robot so it executes everything

plan02.py reads execute.txt and generates commands.txt (parsing)

commands.txt contains the saved vector containing all the cmds that will be executed by the robot using the torobot.py file


In short the user should 
	1 run the new.file.planning.py to create the 2 pddls files
	2 run the ff solver to generate the classical planning and put the result in execute.txt
	3 run the plan02.py file to parse the classical planning which will sqve the result in 		  commands.txt
	4 run the torobot.py file which will run the robot.
